              Hi, my name is Joshua Lee and I am a student at Boston University 
              studying data science and economics. I am interested in the intersection
              between technology and business as I find the two subjects very applicable to
              everyday life. 
            </p>
            <p>
              In my everday life, some hobbies I enjoy doing are playing basketball, trying new foods, traveling to different places
              , and practicing taekwondo. Feel free to contact me with any questions via email: leejosh@bu.edu
            </p>

              <h6>Boston University Facilities Supervisor</h6>
              <p>
                I was responsible for making sure the Boston University Fitness and Recreation Center was in order and different 
                events were planned in a timely and efficient manner. I guided different members around the gym and made sure that 
                people were checking into the gym in a professional state.

                I participated as a waiter where I was in charge of managing and delivering food to approximately 50-60 tables a week.
                I had to talk to customers in a professional setting and make sure they were well assisted whenever they needed utensils or 
                drinks.

              <h6>Soon Coding Academy Volunteer</h6>
              <p>
                I was part of an organization that helped low income individuals have the chance to learn different programming languages. I specialized in python
                and taught a group of 5-6 middle/high schoolers the basics of python programming and solving computational problems.

              <h6>Boston University Finance and Investment Club</h6>
              <p>
                As a quantitative junior analyst, we had weekly lectures on how data science can be used in the world of finance and were given
                different problems to ensure that our computational thinking was improving each week.
